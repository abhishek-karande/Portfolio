## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Abhishek Karande, a Backend Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience. The primary goal of this project is to create a professional online presence that effectively communicates his skills, work history, and personal projects.

**Who is this for?**
*   **Recruiters & Hiring Managers**: To quickly get an overview of Abhishek's qualifications.
*   **Peers & Collaborators**: To showcase technical abilities and find opportunities for collaboration.
*   **Abhishek Karande**: To maintain and update his professional portfolio.

**High-Level Architecture**
The application is a **Server-Side Rendered (SSR)** web app built with **Next.js** using the **App Router**. This architecture was chosen for its excellent performance, SEO benefits, and modern developer experience. The UI is constructed with reusable React components, styled with Tailwind CSS, and leverages ShadCN UI for a consistent and accessible design system.

## Getting Started (Setup Instructions)

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

**Installation:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

---

## Development Guide

**Running the Development Server:**
To start the local development server with hot-reloading enabled, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002). Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

**IDE Configuration:**
*   **VS Code**: It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the following extensions for the best developer experience:
    *   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    *   [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    *   [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

---

## Environment Configuration

This project does not require any environment variables (`.env` file) for its current feature set. If future integrations (e.g., a contact form backend or analytics) are added, the required variables will be documented here. A `.env.example` file will be provided to show the required structure.

---

## Testing Guide

Currently, the project does not have an automated testing suite. As the project grows in complexity, we plan to add unit and integration tests using a framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Debugging Tips

*   **Hydration Errors**: A common issue in Next.js where the server-rendered HTML does not match the client-side render. This is often caused by using browser-specific APIs (like `window` or `localStorage`) or dynamic values (`Math.random()`) outside of a `useEffect` hook. Ensure such code is wrapped in a client-only component or a `useEffect`.
*   **Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying**: If your styles aren't working, ensure the file containing the component is included in the `content` array in `tailwind.config.ts`. Also, verify that there are no typos in your class names.
*   **Server Component vs. Client Component**: Remember that components in the `app` directory are Server Components by default. If you need interactivity, state, or lifecycle effects, you must add the `"use client";` directive at the top of the file.

---

## Code Quality & Conventions

*   **Linting**: We use **ESLint** to enforce consistent coding styles and catch common errors. To run the linter, use:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
*   **Formatting**: Code is formatted automatically on save if you have the Prettier extension configured in your editor.
*   **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new components and logic to ensure type safety.
*   **Component Naming**: Component files should be named in `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `hero-section.tsx`), and the component function itself should be `PascalCase` (e.g., `HeroSection`).

---

## Git Strategy

*   **Branching Model**: We follow a simple feature-branching model.
    *   `main`: This is the primary branch, representing the production-ready code. Direct pushes are disabled.
    *   `develop`: (Optional for solo project) A branch for integrating features before a release.
    *   `feat/feature-name`: Branches for developing new features (e.g., `feat/add-blog-section`).
    *   `fix/bug-name`: Branches for fixing bugs (e.g., `fix/contact-form-validation`).

*   **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
    *   All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request to the `main` branch.
    *   PR titles should be clear and concise.
    *   The PR description should explain the "what" and "why" of the changes.

*   **Commit Messages**: We aim to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This makes the commit history more readable and allows for automated changelog generation.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `feat: Add project filtering by technology`
        *   `fix: Correct alignment of icons in the skills section`
        *   `docs: Update README with deployment instructions`
        *   `style: Adjust primary color saturation`
        *   `refactor: Simplify theme provider logic`

---

## Deployment Process

The project is configured for deployment on **Firebase App Hosting**. The `apphosting.yaml` file contains the basic configuration for the hosting backend.

Deployment is handled automatically via a CI/CD pipeline connected to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository. When a PR is merged into `main`, the pipeline will trigger, build the Next.js application, and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: Why do I see a "404 Not Found" for my resume?**
A: Make sure the `Abhishek_Karande_Resume.pdf` file exists in the `/public` directory at the root of the project. Files in `/public` are served from the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9002/Abhishek_Karande_Resume.pdf`).

**Q: How do I change the color scheme?**
A: The color palette is defined using HSL CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` under the `:root` selector. You can adjust these values to change the site's theme.
